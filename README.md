# Customer-Financial-Profile-Clusters-A-Deep-Dive-into-Debt-Income-and-Default-Risk-Segmentation
This repository showcases an analysis of customer financial profiles through clustering. It leverages key variables—such as age, years employed, income, credit card debt, other debt, default status, and debt-to-income ratio—to segment customers into three distinct clusters:

Cluster 0: Younger customers with moderate income, low debt, and an almost negligible default rate.
Cluster 1: Older, high-income customers carrying higher debt levels, resulting in a moderate risk of default.
Cluster 2: The youngest group, with the lowest income and the highest risk profile, indicated by significant debt and a very high default rate.

The repository includes data preprocessing, clustering implementation, and visualization scripts to help identify and understand these distinct customer segments. This analysis can inform targeted financial strategies and risk management decision
